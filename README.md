## Getting Started

**To get this project set up on your local machine, follow these simple steps:**

**Step 1 React-part**<br>
 - Clone the repo to your local machine.

 - cd inside the project directory.

  - npm install

 - run npm run start
 
 - Change axios request links to `http://localhost:3000` if your rails is in development or change it to your back-end link if your rails is in production. you can find these links in `App, Login, Logout and Signup` components.

**Step 2 Rails Part**<br>

In order to use this project you should have the back end prepared, I will put the link to the Rails back-end [Here](https://github.com/arikarim/React-Rails-Back-End) and all you have to to is follow these simple : 

- Clone the Rails repo and cd inside the project.

- Run `Rake secret`, this will generate a secret key, hold it for the next step.

- Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and inside it put this `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY = < your secret key from previuos step >`

- Inside `config/initializers/cors.rb` if you use it locally you dont need to do this but if you want to use it from specific domain you should change line 12 from `origins '*'` to `origins 'Your front-end domain here'`.

- Note: If you publish this website and upload it to heroku, do not forget to add a `Config variable` to your app in heroku, simply go to heroku, go to your app, click on setting, click on config vars then put your `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` then your secret key.
